## 1. Introduction
`Lichess-MakeChessBetter` is an open-source, fully automated chess execution engine designed to interface natively with the lichess.org Bot API. Constructed using modern Python workflows, the bot acts as a bridge between asynchronous web streaming loops and local command-line chess engine binaries, processing matches across classical formats and alternative variants flawlessly.

## 2. Project Goal
The ultimate core focus of the project is to build an **Adaptive Chess Partner** that dynamically matches an opponent's real-time playing prowess. By calculating performance on a per-move basis, the framework prevents games from feeling stagnant, creating a flexible environment that tests tactical accuracy dynamically throughout the match lifecycles.

## 3. Architecture & Workflow
The system reads gameplay states continuously via streaming long-lived TCP connections, estimating performance using a specialized rolling calculation matrix:

```
   Game Starts
   │
   ├── [1. Default State]
   │     └── Bot initializes at default ELO 1200
   │
   ├── [2. Live Tracking Loop]
   │     ├── Monitors opponent moves continuously
   │     └── Calculates rolling average Centipawn Loss (CPL)
   │
   ├── [3. Dynamic Mapping Phase]
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 15   ➔ ELO 2200 (Master)
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 25   ➔ ELO 2000 (Expert)
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 40   ➔ ELO 1800 (Strong Club)
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 60   ➔ ELO 1600 (Intermediate)
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 90   ➔ ELO 1400 (Casual)
   │     ├── CPL ≤ 130  ➔ ELO 1200 (Beginner)
   │     └── CPL > 130  ➔ ELO 1000 (Newcomer)
   │
   └── [4. Lock-In Phase]
         └── Enforces calculated target ELO for remaining game matrix
```

## 4. Core Features
* **Live CPL Scaling:** Real-time optimization updates that dynamically scale difficulty setting attributes.
* **Variant Integration:** Full execution compatibility with all variants supported by Fairy-Stockfish.
* **Smart Draw Strategy:** Rejects draw queries when holding advantages; accepts when under heavy strain.
* **Predictive Resignations:** Instantly detects unpreventable forced checkmates in 3 moves or fewer.
* **Concurrent Scaling:** Handles multiple asynchronous platform matches running at once.

## 5. Prerequisites & System Requirements
* **Runtime Core:** Python 3.10 or newer (configured along with local virtual environments).
* **Engines:** Local system execution paths pointing to standard Stockfish or Fairy-Stockfish binaries.
* **Platform Constraints:** A dedicated, unplayed Lichess profile upgraded strictly to a `BOT` status.

## 6. Installation Blueprint
To deploy using the pre-compiled Python distribution packaging wheels, run the installation sequence directly through your tool terminal:
```bash
pip install MakeChessBetter-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```
To run directly from the raw source code compression archive, unpack the package components manually:
```bash
tar -xvf MakeChessBetter-2.0.1.tar.gz
cd MakeChessBetter-2.0.1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 7. Environment Configuration
The application consumes standard credentials through an active `.env` configuration template or a localized configuration layout. Create a `config.yml` block in your workspace path:
```yaml
token: "lip_YOUR_SECURE_LICHESS_API_TOKEN"
engine:
  path: "./stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe"
  variants: "./fairy-stockfish-largeboard_x86-64.exe"
```
Alternatively, apply configuration rules directly using a root `.env` template parameter configuration:
```env
LICHESS_TOKEN=lip_yourtoken
```

## 9. Detailed Module Breakdown
* **`src/RateLimit429Stopper.py`**: Controls request intervals, intercepts outgoing API packets, and blocks 429 throttling errors.
* **`src/__init__.py`**: Establishes directory package mapping and exposes inner module namespaces for local imports.
* **`src/bot.py`**: Boots the foundational framework runtime, sets up thread pools, and listens to event pipes.
* **`src/game_handler.py`**: Implements state rules, reads board steps, and processes challenge transactions.
* **`src/history_manager.py`**: Stores raw coordinate logs, indexes game history indices, and tracks user performance timelines.
* **`src/openings.py`**: Indexes move tree registries to execute hardcoded theoretical opening lines automatically.
* **`src/scout.py`**: Scrapes profile data streams to map playstyle habits and parse enemy tactic blindspots.
* **`src/skill_estimator.py`**: Tracks analytical evaluation metrics to map centipawn metrics directly onto target ratings.

## 10. Deployed Bot
The backend server is live on Render: [Live Server Status](https://lichess-inappropriate-bot.onrender.com/)

**How to Play / Interact**
Since this is a backend Lichess bot, you don't interact with the Render link directly. Instead:
1. Go to **Lichess.org**.
2. Search for the bot's username: `MakeChessBetter`.
3. Challenge the bot to a game or send it a message to see it in action!


## 11. Advanced Usage Framework
Launch the tool package command interface execution entry point natively via the active console window:
```bash
MakeChessBetter
```
For deep application tracing or to enforce active execution visibility without immediate background detachment, run the raw script modules via:
```bash
python -m src.bot
```
* **Silent Mode Execution (Windows):** Suppress the command console pop-up layer by utilizing `pythonw bot.py`.
* **Detached Runtime (Linux/Mac):** Maintain long-term execution after dropping SSH sessions via `nohup python bot.py &`.

## 12. API & Programmatic Reference
The internal handlers parse data properties streaming from Lichess's public development entry channels:
* `GET /api/stream/event`: Establishes the real-time event pipeline to intercept Incoming game challenges.
* `POST /api/bot/game/{gameId}/move/{move}`: Ships calculated chess engine calculations back to the board matrix.
* `POST /api/bot/game/{gameId}/chat`: Emits automated status alerts directly to the in-game log panel.

## 13. Troubleshooting & Diagnostics
* **Flashing Window/Instant Exit:** Avoid clicking raw module paths directly from the explorer window. Launch the module commands manually from an already open terminal window to capture active error flags.
* **401 Authentication Validation Errors:** Confirm your token features the authorized `bot:play` permission configuration.
* **Engine Connection Timeout:** Ensure path variables in `config.py` point directly to legitimate engine instances.

## 14. Performance Fine-Tuning
Optimize your engine properties for low-latency calculations:
* **Core Distribution:** Align the calculation process properties explicitly with actual machine CPU core limitations.
* **Hash Optimization:** Raise local allocation ceilings (e.g., to 2048MB) within your script configuration values to accelerate high-depth searches.
